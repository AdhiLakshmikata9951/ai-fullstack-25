            Web development is the process of building and maintaining
             websites and web applications. It encompasses
              a wide range of tasks, 
             from designing the user interface (front-end) to managing the server-side
              logic and databases (back-end). Web development requires a combination of
               technical skills, creativity, and problem-solving 
               abilities.
